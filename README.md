============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aadl/ansible-role-docker-php.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aadl/ansible-role-docker-php)

Ansible role to manage and run the alpine php fpm docker container.

Requirements
------------

Since this uses Ansible's docker module, you will need to ensure that a recent-ish version of `docker-py` and `docker` are installed.
